# 3D Rubik's Cube Simulator

## Description
Welcome to the 3D Rubik's Cube simulator, a project entirely crafted in C++ from the ground up. This program allows users to experience the classic 3x3 Rubik's Cube in a 3D environment. The SDL2 library has been leveraged to provide a graphical interface for an immersive user experience.

## Future Improvements
- **Optimized Rotation Functions:** Work is underway to enhance rotation functions, ensuring smoother and more intuitive manipulation of the Rubik's Cube.
- **Expanded Cube Sizes:** Expect updates to introduce various cube sizes, catering to users with different skill levels and preferences.
- **Algorithms:** I am going to add cube-solving algorithms
- **Shuffler:** Auto cube shuffler will be added soon.
